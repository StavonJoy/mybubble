Social distancing is an important safety measure during the COVID-19 pandemic. With a wealth of technology at our fingertips we are able to better prepare and organize our lives to accomodate the necessary precautions during these unprecedented times.


## Welcome to MyBubble
----- 
MyBubble is a web-based app that uses your mobile device's camera to display your personal bubble, or multiple bubbles, to help us keep physically distanced. We utilized [echoAR](https://www.echoar.xyz/) to create our AR social distancing hack.
